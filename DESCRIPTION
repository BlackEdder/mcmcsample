Description: This package includes tools to work with posterior samples,
    e.g. samples resulting from a MCMC run. It focusses on working on
    multidimensional samples, while keeping the dependencies between
    different parameters intact. In general it tries to avoid any type
    of smoothing, but works directly with the actual samples. It includes
    functions to plot the different posterior samples, calculate and plot
    credible regions and other helper functions.
